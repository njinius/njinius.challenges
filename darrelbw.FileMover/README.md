# Challenge Name: 
### Challenge: File mover
# Challenge Description:
I have multiple tools on my machine that save their configuration on xml, txt files
I've got SQL tools that hold snippets to save time typing
I've got Notepad++ macros
I have Chrome bookmarks
I've got powershell scripts
All these tools store their configuration information on files. This means when I make a change to a certain tool (E.g. Update a SQL snippet - then the corresponding configuration file is also updated.)
The Issue:
I need a way to periodically copy these configuration files from multiple folder locations and move them to one location (GoogleDrive, Dropbox or any other cloud storage). This way every time I update my tools, the configuration files are automatically backed up. Now this may also encounter "File already in use" issues
What are the possible solutions to this problem and what language/technology can I use to solve it (edited)
